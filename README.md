# MotionLight

Milestone 1:
The code in the .ino file contains the code for the Arduino. The code contains couple of Serial.print() lines, which keeps track of times where is detected. There is also some lines of code in the setup that runs for about 30 seconds to give times for the sensor to calibrate. Here is the source code: http://tolsonwinters.com/a/PIR_Sensor_With_LED.ino

Milestone 2:
The code in the .ino file for milestone 2 includes the Adafruit's NeoPixel library. To install the library go to this website: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/arduino-library-installation. The code now counts using a for-loop, so there is no longer a super long delay as the pause. Here is the source code for the fade function: http://moving-rainbow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/fade-in-and-out/.
